# Data Warehouse Architecture - Raw Layer, Stage Layer, and Core Layer
In data warehousing, an architecture with distinct layers is used to organize and process data efficiently. This project follows an ideal modeling architecture, which consists of three main layers: Raw Layer, Stage Layer, and Core Layer. Each layer serves a specific purpose in the data management and transformation process, ensuring data integrity and providing a solid foundation for analytics and reporting.

#### 1. Raw Layer:
The Raw Layer is the initial storage location for the data as it is ingested from the data source. In this project, the data source is represented by CSV files on the local machine. The main characteristics of the Raw Layer include:

* Data Ingestion: The data is loaded directly from the source (CSV files) into the Raw Layer, maintaining the same structure as the source.

* Minimal Transformation: In this layer, the data remains largely unaltered, with minimal or no data transformations applied. The focus is on preserving the raw data exactly as it is extracted.

* Built Incrementally: The Raw Layer allows data to be loaded incrementally over time, enabling updates and additions to the dataset.

* Deduplication: Measures are taken to eliminate duplicate data and maintain data consistency.

* The Raw Layer serves as the historical record of the source data, ensuring the availability of the original data for future transformations or auditing purposes.

#### 2. Stage Layer:
The Stage Layer acts as an intermediate storage area where data from the Raw Layer is cleansed, enriched, and prepared for further processing. The main characteristics of the Stage Layer include:

* Data Transformation: Data from the Raw Layer is transformed into a consistent format suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, standardizing data types, and cleansing data.

* Data Enrichment: Additional data may be added to enrich the original dataset, such as lookup values or data from external sources.

* Data Quality Checks: Validation rules and data quality checks are applied to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

* Tabular Format: Data in the Stage Layer is organized in tabular format, making it suitable for data processing.

* No Joins between Tables: The Stage Layer typically avoids joins between the tables to maintain data simplicity and improve performance.

* The Stage Layer acts as a "cleaning room" for the data, preparing it for further usage and processing in the Core Layer.

#### 3. Core Layer:
The Core Layer is where the data is organized into a structured and optimized format, ready for analytical purposes and reporting. The main characteristics of the Core Layer include:

* Data Modeling: Data models, such as star or snowflake schemas, are designed to organize data into facts (measures) and dimensions (attributes).

* Business Logic: Business rules and calculations are applied to the data to create meaningful metrics and KPIs.

* Dimensional Modeling: Data in the Core Layer is organized into facts and dimensions using techniques that facilitate efficient querying and analysis.

* High Data Quality Standards: Rigorous technical tests are applied to ensure high data quality and reliability.

* The Core Layer forms the foundation for business intelligence and reporting tools to interact with the data. It provides a unified and consistent view of the data, making it easier for analysts and decision-makers to query and interpret the information.

Overall, the use of the Raw Layer, Stage Layer, and Core Layer in the data warehouse architecture ensures data integrity, improves data processing capabilities, and supports agile data warehousing practices for effective data analysis and reporting.
